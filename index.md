I am a Mechanical Engineering PhD student at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu). I work in the [Coimbra Energy Group](http://coimbra.ucsd.edu/) and am involved with the [IDEA Student Cenrter](http://idea.ucsd.edu/) as well as the [Center for Energy Research](http://cer.ucsd.edu/).

I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering from [UC Merced](http://www.ucmerced.edu/) and then my MS in Mechanical Engineering from [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu). During my undergrad, I participated in research through the [UC LEADS](http://ogs-leads.ucsd.edu/) and [Cal NERDS](http://ucberkeleynerds.com) programs.
