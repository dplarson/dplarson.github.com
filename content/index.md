I am a PhD candidate in [MAE](http://mae.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu/). My advisor is [Carlos Coimbra](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=324) and I work in the [Coimbra Energy Group](http://coimbra.ucsd.edu/) on developing forecasting models for solar power plants.

I have a MS in Mechanical Engineering from UC San Diego and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from [UC Merced](http://ucmerced.edu/). During my time at UC Merced, I participated in the [UC LEADS](http://ucleads.org/) and [Cal NERDS](http://ucberkeleynerds.com/) summer research programs.

Outside of research, I act as an instructor for [ENG 10](http://eng10.ucsd.edu/) and regularly present technical workshops, in collaboration with the [IDEA Student Center](http://idea.ucsd.edu).
