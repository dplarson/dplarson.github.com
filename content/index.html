I am a Mechanical Engineering PhD student at [UCSD][ucsd]. I work in the [Coimbra Solar Forecast Engine Lab][coimbra-lab] and am involved with the [IDEA Scholars Program][idea].

I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [UC Merced][ucm], and am an alumni of the [UC LEADS][leads] and [Cal NERDS][nerds] programs.

My CV is available <a href="{{ media_url('David_Larson.pdf') }}">here</a>.



### Research Interests
My research focuses on the applying machine learning and non-integer order methods to solar forecasting and nonlinear chaos. More details on my current and past research work can be seen [here](research.html).



### Technical Skillsets
* Programming: *Matlab, Python, Mathematica*
* Rapid Protptyping: *CAD, 3D printing, CNC and manual machining*
* Data Analysis and Visualization
