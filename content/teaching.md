### Teaching
I currently teach [ENG 10: Fundamentals of Engineering Applications](http://eng10.ucsd.edu), a hands-on course that provides students with an introduction to engineering mathematics and design.  From Fall 2013 to Spring 2016, I was a TA for a freshmen engineering seminar ([ENG 1-3: Orientation to Engineering I-III](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/programs/ote.shtml)).
