## Current Projects

#### Variable Order Differential Equations (VODEs)
Developing numerical methods for solving VODEs, including methods to approximate VODEs using Constant Order (CO) derivatives. In general, a VODE is of the form:

$$ D^{2} x(t) + c_0 D^{q(x,t)} x(t) + k_0 D^{0} x(t) = F(t)$$

where $q(x,t)$ is the order of the VO-derivative, $c_0$ and $k_0$ are contants, and $F(t)$ is the forcing function.


#### Evolutionary Non-Integer Order Methods (ENIOs)
Investigating evolutionary methods (e.g. Genetic Algorithms) coupled with Non-Integer Order Methods (i.e. Fractional and Variable Order) as applied to time series.



## Past Projects

#### Effect of Turbulent Air Flow on Hummingbird Kinematics and Metabolism
[Animal Flight Lab](http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/dudley/), UC Berkeley (summer 2011)

Analyzed the effects of turbulent air flow on hummingbird flight, using flapping kinematics and metabolic rates as references. Flapping kinematics were studied using a system of high speed cameras while metabolism was calculated via an oxygen consumption sensor placed inside a feeding flower. Turbulence was produced using mesh grids mounted in a wind tunnel while turbulence levels were analyzed using Laser Particle Image Velocimetry (LPIV) methods.

#### Aerodynamic Trends for Biological Flapping Flight
[Coimbra Group](http://coimbra.ucsd.edu/), UC Merced (summer 2010)

Performed detailed analysis of pre-existing studies on biological flapping flight in an attempt to determine dimensionless trends.
